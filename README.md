10. Call to Action:
    - What is a call to action in the context of a software project pitch? Provide examples of effective calls to action that can be used to close your pitch.

CTA is an acronym used to express a “call to action.” The term describes those texts or buttons that aim to get visitors to a website, social media page, a mailer, or other virtual locations. They’re overall measures to get users to take a specific action that we want them to execute. As a vital concept in Marketing, CTAs refer to those particular points where we literally ask audiences to do what we ideally need them to do.

Here are some commonly used examples of CTA's in a pitch:
- The “Read more” button: 
Don’t just give away all of your promo material, neither for free nor right away. On the contrary, make people work a little bit for it. A “read more” button can get people to click for more content, information, and other sales or engagement points.
-Social media sharing: 
This CTA is essential nowadays to get people to share content on LinkedIn or any social media platform. It’s a way to get others to know our brand and company, too.
-“Buy now” "Show now": 
Look at this Adidas example of a call to action. Their “shop now” button is simple, and people know straight away where to go to do what, exactly. 
-Visit site”: 
Regardless of where we place an ad, we want visitors to explore our sites and broader offer. For that, create CTAs that invite users to go to a full site and linger to take a look around.
-Invitation to a Demo or Presentation: "I invite you to experience our software firsthand. Let's schedule a demo where I can show you our latest features and discuss how they align with your investment goals."
